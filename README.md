Redesign of La Maison patisserie: http://www.lmpatisserie.com.au/



Project Overview

La Maison Patisserie is front end only website based on my redesign of the businessâ€™s website completed during assignment 2. The website showcases their cakes and facilitates the purchase for in store collection. The website is responsive in desktop and mobile to enable user experience across devices.

Its key features include a product catalogue: Users can view the available products with their pricing, image and description and add to cart in responsive quantities.

Shopping cart and checkout: Customers can adjust quantities and remove products with an instant update on price and summary, they can choose their date and time of collection and leave a comment, the payment screen gives feedback on correct input to avoid errors in payment. 

The design is consistent with my Figma boards maintaining the predetermined aesthetic, the project uses modular CSS, semantic html and organised JavaScript to ensure the code can be maintained and updated.
Overall, the websites implementation ensures the business has a stronger online presence and facilitates usability and user experience.

Enjoy!!
